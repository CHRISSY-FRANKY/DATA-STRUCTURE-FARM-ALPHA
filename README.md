# DATA STRUCTURE FARM 🧑‍🌾🐄

Welcome to *Data Structure Farm*, where we raise and nurture a variety of data structures with data instead of food as if they were farm animals. Each data structure is a unique creature, living and growing on our digital farm, offering a fun and interactive way to learn and apply complex concepts. They cover runtimes from O(n) to O(log(n)) and beyond.
